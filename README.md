## Objectives

Why is pharmaceutical regulation in need of introducing blockchain technology? Compared to other healthcare industries, the pharmaceutical industry has a substantial amount of governmental regulation.

Technological solutions are commonly developed exogenously from governmental regulation, however we want innovation to be intricately woven into its regulatory structures.

Registered practitioners are required to keep records of controlled substances they have dispensed to patients. By leveraging uniquely identifiable addresses within ethereum, pharmacists could have a trusted, verified method to access pharmaceutical transactions. And by leveraging smart contracts, pharmacists could provide prescription information straight to the patientâ€™s ethereum address.
